In section 1 we learned how to calculate probabilities with various libraries and methods. We also explored concepts such as weighted sample spaces and convert problems without weights in the sample space into a weighted sample space problem. In section 2 we took the porbablilties and functions from the first section and used Matplotlib to create visualizations of these functions. We explored how to change graph types such as changing to a scatterplot, shading intervals(set and extremes), adding axis titles, comparing two distributions, and making different distributions relative to one another.
