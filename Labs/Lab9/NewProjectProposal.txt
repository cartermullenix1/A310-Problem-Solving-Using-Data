Project Desciption: The goal of this project is to create a model that is able to determine market campaigns based on income and past spending data. Marketing
campaigns typically target those with higher incomes because the likelihood of them spending more money is higher due to the higher levels
of disposible income in these demographics. K-Means clustering is a commonly used algorithm for clustering unlabled data. K is the number of
clusters that you want the data grouped into. The number of clusters that you want has to be determined ahead of time to use this type of
clustering. The Elbow Method is what is used to manually find the K value for this type of clustering. This method uses the value of inertia
that is found by training K-Mean clusters with different K values and plots it on a graph. This method finds income and spending plots
separately then combines them in the end showing a income and spending projection to give a target demographic for marketing campaigns.

Libraries and Dataset: The libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The data set is provided in the book as a link
to a GitHub file which is a .csv file.

Data Preprocessing: The data comes in a .csv file that is already cleaned and preprocessed, so no preprocessing is required.

Model used in Project: The model used in this project is a K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

End Goal: The program that I will write will create clusters from customer income, spending, and spending score data. I can use the knowledge of how
to create and use this algorthim to apply it to data sets to determine what groups to market more heavily to.
